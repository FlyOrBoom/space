Hallo, I'm an artist, programmer, and astrophysics student.
I'm currently in my second year of undergraduate studies in math and physics at UC Berkeley.
This is my little spot on the interwebs.

## Notes

I keep typed-up notes on some astrophysics textbooks, as well as standalone topics
- [Dodelson & Schmidt, *Modern Cosmology*](/notes/modern-cosmology)
- [Caroll & Ostlie, *Introduction to Modern Astrophysics*](/notes/intro-to-modern-astrophysics)
- [Relativistic fluids](/notes/relativistic-fluids)

## Bookshelf

I'm very much a textbooks-and-lecture-notes person --- 
I find going through them to be far more effective at building a deep understanding than listening to live lectures. 
Here are the documents that I have read significant portions of and found helpful in my studies. They are roughly sorted by stars in their difficulty. Their categories are approximate, and get increasingly blended with each other at the more advanced levels.

\* light: no prerequisites \
\*\* introductory: requires some mathematical maturity \
\*\*\* medium: a more sophisticated second exposure \
\*\*\*\* advanced: requires specialized mathematical background \
\*\*\*\*\* hella advanced
