Hallo, I'm an artist, programmer, and astrophysics student.
I'm currently in my second year of undergraduate studies in math and physics at UC Berkeley.
This is my little spot on the interwebs.

## Notes

I keep typed-up notes on some astrophysics textbooks, as well as standalone topics.
Most of them are very incomplete, but if I end up settling down in astrophysics I hope to complete them :)
- [Notes on Dodelson & Schmidt, *Modern Cosmology*](/notes/modern-cosmology) (WIP)
- [Notes on Carroll & Ostlie, *Introduction to Modern Astrophysics*](/notes/intro-to-modern-astrophysics) (Parts I & II)
- [Relativistic fluids from relativistic dust](/notes/relativistic-fluids)
- [What’s “topological” about topological defects?](/notes/topological-defects)
- [The background of the universe](/notes/medium) (WIP)
- [What is the Hubble Tension?](/notes/hubble-tension)
- [The wave optics of gravitational lensing](/notes/gravitational-lensing) (WIP)

I'm very much a textbooks-and-lecture-notes person --- 
I find going through them to be far more effective at building a deep understanding than listening to live lectures. 
Here are the documents that I have read significant portions of and found helpful in my studies. They are roughly sorted by stars in their difficulty. Their categories are approximate, and get increasingly blended with each other at the more advanced levels.

\* light: no prerequisites \
\*\* introductory: requires some mathematical maturity \
\*\*\* medium: a more sophisticated second exposure \
\*\*\*\* advanced: requires specialized mathematical background \
\*\*\*\*\* hella advanced
